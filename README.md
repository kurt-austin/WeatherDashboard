# WeatherDashboard
This website takes user input of a city and displays the current conditions (Temperature/Humidity/Cloud Cover/Wind Speed/UV Index) at the searched for location.  The UV Index is highlighted in different colors depending upon the currentIt also displays the current 5 day forecast for that city.  When a user searches for another city, the application puts the previous city searched in a history list.  If the browser is refreshed, the application takes the last searched.

The application uses two API calls from the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities.  The first call to obtain the Latitude and Longitude coordinates for the searched location.  It takes that information to make a second call to retrieve all of the weather details.  The reason for two calls is that neither provide all of the information solely for the application.

The makeup of the application consists of HTML (both pre-built and dynamic HTML generated by Javascript), JQuery for the two AJAX (API calls), Javascript, and a combination of custom CSS along with CSS Bootstrap and Fontawesome classes.

The application also uses time for dates from MomentJS.

Here is a sample screenshot of the application.
